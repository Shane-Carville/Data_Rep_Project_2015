## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Galway City PLaygrounds" which is available at [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-playground-locations). The purpose of this project is to create an API that can be useful to the intended audience and is also easy to use.

## Users of the Dataset
> - *Parents*
> - *Baby Sitters*
> - *Schools on a trip*
> - *County Council*

These are just a few examples of users of the dataset.Parents and baby sitters to find their local playground, schools to take kids to after a trip and the county council to see where the current playgrounds are and where they should place the next one if needed.
