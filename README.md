Student Name: Shane Carville

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Galway City PLaygrounds" which is available at [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-playground-locations). The purpose of this project is to create an API that can be useful to the intended audience and is also easy to use.

##About the Data
This dataset was found at the previously mentioned URL, in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from [*data.gove.ie*](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-playground-locations/resource/b81820b4-dd2e-4181-b93b-d2033a9f9a85).
The CSV file has 31 rows, with the first being the header or id of the column
There are fifteen values on each line, though some are not as useful as others I have selected the most useful for the user.
    - **name**: the name of the playground.
    - **location**: the location of the playground.
    - **surface**: the type of surface at the playground.
    - **parking**: if the playground has parking or not.
    - **opening hours**: the opening hours of the playground.
    - **toilet facilities**: if the playground has toilets or not.
    - **equipment**: if the playground has any specialised equipment e.g basketball courts
    - **latitude**: the latitue position of the playground.
    - **longitude**: the longitude position of the playdround.

## Users of the Dataset
> - *Parents*
> - *Baby Sitters*
> - *Schools on a trip*
> - *County Council*

These are just a few examples of users of the dataset.Parents and baby sitters to find their local playground, schools to take kids to after a trip and the county council to see where the current playgrounds are and where they should place the next one if needed.
